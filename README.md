# Chris Osborne's Profile

This is a profile for Chris Osborne with some basic information on himself and what he has worked on inorder to improve his chances of getting hired for web development. It is still missing a lot of projects so there are 3 filler objects. 

I wanted the profile to include a brief description, links to projects I am working on as well as a way to contact me if you are interested in hiring me.
